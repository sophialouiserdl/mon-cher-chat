#  Mon Cher Chat: Private Local LLM Chatbot üê±üéÄ

## Project Overview

**Mon Cher Chat** is a conversational chatbot prototype developed for demonstrating secure, high-performance local AI deployment. The solution integrates the **DeepSeek-R1** Large Language Model (LLM), utilizing **Ollama** as the local runtime and **Streamlit** for the interactive web interface.

This architecture serves as a crucial demonstration of modern, cost-effective LLM engineering principles. By prioritizing **local execution** and **data privacy**, the system establishes a robust blueprint for building secure, custom AI tools. This approach is highly relevant for enterprise applications requiring stringent data privacy and regulatory compliance, such as internal knowledge management or confidential document analysis. The design effectively eliminates recurring cloud service costs and minimizes latency, proving the technical viability of running powerful models affordably and securely within an organization's infrastructure.

### üîé Technical Highlights

The Mon Cher Chat application is engineered for performance, privacy, and seamless operation through the following key components:

* **Secure Local Deployment:** The entire stack, from the **DeepSeek-R1:1.5b** model to the **Streamlit UI**, is configured for local execution, ensuring **100% data privacy** and eliminating dependency on external APIs or cloud providers.
* **Persistent Context & Memory:** Conversational memory management is implemented via `st.session_state` to maintain the full conversation history. This capability allows the model to generate **coherent, context-aware responses** over long, multi-turn dialogues.
* **High-Fidelity LLM Integration:** The system leverages **Ollama** and **LangChain** to efficiently manage the DeepSeek-R1 model, which is recognized for its advanced reasoning capabilities comparable to leading proprietary models.
* **Custom User Experience:** A responsive and modern chat interface was developed using Streamlit, complemented by custom styling, ensuring a polished and intuitive user experience.

## üîé Architecture and Technologies

| Category | Tool / Technology | Role in the Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LLM (Model)** | **DeepSeek-R1:1.5b** | The core model responsible for all response generation. |
| **LLM Runtime** | **Ollama** | Manages, serves, and exposes the LLM via a local API endpoint. |
| **Interface Web** | **Streamlit** | Python framework used for rapid front-end development. |
| **Logic** | **Python 3.x + LangChain** | Primary language and framework for handling model communication, memory, and application logic. |
| **Source Code** | `app.py` | The main script orchestrating the UI, memory, and the critical `llm.invoke()` calls. |

## üîé Setup and Installation Guide

To run this chatbot, you must have **Git**, **Python**, and the **Ollama** application installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Configure Environment and LLM

1.  **Install Ollama** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Download the DeepSeek-R1 model:**
    ```bash
    ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
    ```

### Step 2: Clone and Install Dependencies

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sophialouiserdl/mon-cher-chat.git](https://github.com/sophialouiserdl/mon-cher-chat.git)
    cd mon-cher-chat
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies** (from `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Chatbot

1.  Ensure the **Ollama** application is running in the background.
2.  Execute the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
The chat interface will automatically open in your web browser.
